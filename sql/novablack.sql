He takes detailed notes not only providing a numerical score but taking notes that are attached to each members profile (that only leadership can view). This allows a Division or Section leader to have some really good details while putting together their team for your mission! Again, all this is done to ensure success in what you hire us to do!

To do this, we look for volunteers for every mission. Based on what the customer has offered to pay/what kind of mission or package they have purchased from us, leadership will create a mission. When doing so, they will list what positions are needed, what ships are needed, when and where the mission will begin, how long it&#39;s expected to take, etc. Once the mission is created it will appear in every member&#39;s profile page as displayed in this blog. When they click on a mission, it will pop up with a display showing all the information and allow them to select which positions they are willing to do within that mission. Once that data is collected, the mission creater will go in, review the candidates, review their training stats, ships, etc and put together their team for that mission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere should be absolutely no doubt that we put a lot of effort into every mission and ensuring it&#39;s success. Our tactical advisor will let you know if he feels the package you selected isn&#39;t sufficient enough to ensure success as well as let you know if you are selecting a bit of overkill.

(259, '', 'eric@talkwithcustomer.com', 2, 1, 'Hello,\r\n\r\nRunning a website like novabl4ck.org is a lot like trying to fill a leaky bucket.\r\n\r\nYou promote, get website visitor, they drop out... you promote, get more website visitors, they drop out...\r\n\r\nBut today I wanted to address the \"leaky bucket\" effect that keeps website owners and online businesses running on a treadmill without reaching their income goals.\r\n\r\nI\'ve identified 5 ongoing challenges that can keep you from reaching your business goals with your online business offering.\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 1: Attracting Leads and Getting People to Opt-In\r\n\r\nIn order to sustain your website and sell your product, you need people who are interested enough to actually consider your offers.\r\n\r\nBuilding an engaged list of subscribers is the key here... but did you know there\'s a way your website can help you with that?\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 2: Converting Leads into Happy Paying Customers\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve figured out a way to get more people to join your email list, you need to tell them about your paid product and offerings in a way that converts.\r\n\r\nThe standard email marketing funnel works... but if they don\'t buy, there are more organic ways to get them to purchase your paid offerings right inside your website.\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 3: Having a Leaky Checkout Experience & Losing Out On Sales\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve done all of the hard work of getting people to say yes to your paid offerings... you definitely don\'t want to lose out on sales by having a leaky checkout experience.\r\n\r\nStatistics show that 77% of people who click the “Buy Now” button never complete their order, but there\'s a way to recoup these sales.\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 4: Increasing Return Customers and Recurring Revenue\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve got customers... your job is done, right? Not so fast!\r\n\r\nYou can offer more solutions, products, and ongoing access to these same customers over time... because the probability of selling to a new prospect is 5-20% and the probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%.\r\n\r\nOngoing Challenge 5: Customers Who Fall Off The Wagon and do not buy\r\n\r\nCustomer retention is key to the long-term success of your website. But it\'s normal for customers to fall off the wagon, get busy, and stop logging into your website.\r\n\r\nOr is it?\r\n\r\nIf you use smart nurturing strategies, you can keep your customers engaged and actively benefitting from your website to reduce drop offs and refunds.\r\n\r\nHow our software overcomes each of these ongoing challenges:\r\n\r\nThese are real challenges that never seem to go away...\r\n\r\nI know because I\'ve been there myself.

It was only when the Tories came in and implanted austerity that the recover became remarkably drawn out.The reason the UK was exposed was because of financial deregulation as a result of the Tories and then New Labour after them.

The woman from Wayne County received a voice message from Jerry Kudajeski. He said he was an Avoca police officer interested in learning the needs of her.\r\n\r\n\"in fact, He knew people that I knew, And his industry, And we just <a href=https://medium.com/@spanishwomen/travel-to-spain-find-the-spanish-beauty-f06fc1e9f9b0>woman in spanish</a> kind of hit it off on the unit, And it kind of went after that,\r\n\r\nShe says within five weeks it was over and her account with a bank about $2,000 little.\r\n\r\n\"It was only a few weeks until he was into my information and into the bank account and I didn\'t realize it,\r\n\r\nKudajeski is now behind bars and facing a felony fraud charge for what went down late last month. The woman says Kudajeski called her in an anxiety. He had deplete all of your gas and asked for the numbers to her Honesdale National Bank debit card.\r\n\r\n\"I noticed bad, That\'s the kind of person I am. I felt bad and proclaimed, \'alright.\' and I did something totally against my gut reaction,\r\n\r\nBefore she realised, relevant to $2,000 went losing out on from her account. Police say Kudajeski used it to pay bills for his family.\r\n\r\nIt turns out he\'s married and the woman suspects all that is remotely truthful Kudajeski told her was about his job.\r\n\r\nHe previously served as an Avoca police sergeant in 2014 but the chief of the department says Kudajeski resigned almost many years ago.\r\n\r\n\"There\'s a menagerie of stuff that I missed,\r\n\r\nThe woman works with police to arrest Kudajeski. She asked to meet him wednesday evening in Carbondale. She noticed him at a Turkey Hill in town where police put him in cuffs.\r\n\r\nThe woman says taking a look at it all, She felt sorry for her former boyfriend and humiliated about being made a victim, despite the fact that, She does not want this to happen to anyone else.\r\n', 0),

They always on standby their husband, toddler, little princess, Or any other family member it doesn\'t matter what hard things get if they know they can fix their problems. ( Full explanation )\r\n\r\ncounseling,why men prefer skinny women?\r\n\r\nHere is an accurate or REAL answer backed by science, Statistics and thousands of times of recorded history: Genetics and major gender traits selection for survival of the species. possibly the best person at conveying these genetic traits of beauty across time, cultures and even species(If not absolutely the most accurate in all his theories) will \"Desmond Morris, He is a world renowned human anthropologist has a number of books and documentaries on the subject, But the best or most at your disposal one as a starter is The Human Animal (1994, BBC). why choose \"lean, Well that\'s not quite correct either. Men are naturally attracted to what is generally the healthiest female body type for their future offspring plus some traits that developed alongside our evolution as Desmond and there are more make a good case. So are anemically skinny women with insufficient body fat generally easy for most men? correct. From Kate Moss to the anorexic type of female forms is almost as unattractive as the extremely overwieght ones. Body and face symmetry are other examples of common beauty across sexes and the animal kingdom as they indicate less genetic flaws or closer to perfection. The beauty variations throughout history and cultures often exaggerated for political effect are far less and mostly outliers vs. those commonality. Cleopatra would still be regarded as quite beautiful today. Controlled studies of men across cultures today not only show common physical traits owning their views of beauty, But far more independent of race or ethnicity than the media or politics would imply. the clutched at is the rubanesque period (One moment in time, In one region), But what is neglected is a separate discussion of the painter\'s individual favorite vs. Society as a whole or the world at this stage. Usually the correct answer for most deviations from what would otherwise be the norm without such influence. The food industry has purposefully messed with our normal and natural food ingredients(MSG, therefore forth.) Not just to regain it cheaper, But as addictive as possible very much the same as nicotine spiking so we eat well past our normal hunger levels. That this creates a cycle and since heavier or more obese people eat even more food is recognized a positive. If companies also make money off selling dieting or health industry products or procedures either to handle the complications caused by this excess fat or obesity if not directly then that is more money too. You should not be surprised by the fact that you have a \"Synergy\" Between selling the addictive cheap food that makes us fat and then products or drugs to take care of that situation too (Sometimes companies sell on each side too). Has the media in all forms created a false ideal of beauty that almost no human woman can achieve? Yes as their digital making improvements to of those already at the extremes shows. Does this mean that all men are naturally consumed by or expect such extremes? Not on average, But the one area or trait that is possible to control is body fat and muscle tone that is very hardwired into male attraction and it\'s main visual nature. you may have to avoid most or all processed foods or workout more to compensate, But men will always judgemental for what was originally designated as healthy body fat women (Before they started messing with the dimensions) Or perhaps still the technically ideal or as close without being obsessive and overly vain. As fellas(and ladies) develop fully, They are able to rely less on the opinions of others so to formulate their own. During this process the individual separates from larger groups to the company of smaller social circles and less outside influences as more individual decisions are made and self-confidence is gathered. an individual may still feel that \"skeletal\" Women are a more paper forms attractive, But not solely based on building up. Later in using this method, Body type is demoted in neuro-scientific attraction by other qualities deemed more important. This linear pathway is not followed by everyone, you can, And not at the same speed or trajectory. On a student basis, It is better to not let the opinion of another of ones self to obstruct your own judgment of self. To aim to meet the desires of others is to live their lives and ideals and not your own. Just be your edition of healthy, Both physically and emotionally. Letting you be you will attract an even better \"fit and healthy\" For long term a friendly relationship.

I manage the big brands. \r\nLast year was all about my health so I made a health focused goal and nailed it but this year I decided to do something for others. \r\nSo I made a New Year’s Resolution to invest 10 minutes into helping one person a day for the entire year, it has been a fulfilling new year’s resolution indeed. \r\nToday I came across your site as I was working on one of your competitor’s marketing campaigns and when I saw your site I was impressed by the effort you have made and the thought and detail you have applied to the front end. \r\nHowever it is highly evident that you have not applied any time or knowledge into what I consider to be the most important part of your business. \r\nYour reach is lacking, without reach you are limiting your customer base. This is overwhelming for a lot of small businesses. \r\nFor me to help you by physically doing the work for you would cost you a lot and I am not here to do that. \r\nInstead I am giving you the biggest tip you will ever receive and something I do not share ever as it would put me out of business. \r\nYou can do this yourself. You don’t need to be an expert to be ranking with the big boys. \r\nAll of us marketing experts use tools, they do all the work we just navigate them and really it’s something anyone can do but we don’t tell our clients this. \r\nThis is the most effective tool used in the marketing world and what myself, my team and all of the experts in our industry rely on. \r\nhttp://seo-leader.tech/seo-tools \r\nIf you want to take your business to the next level this is the equivalent of hiring a solid marketing team, it is not difficult to use and it will give you a huge foot up on your competitors. \r\nAs I said you have set up everything on the front end perfectly so you will convert well once you get your reach right. \r\nI will check in on your progress from time to time. Hopefully I see you ranking for higher volume keywords and even out ranking my client! \r\nYou have everything you need, stay focused and you will get there. \r\n \r\nBest, \r\nSteve', 0),

I am looking at your website now.\r\n\r\nIt gets traffic every day – that you’re probably spending $2 / $4 / $10 or more a click to get.  Not including all of the work you put into creating social media, videos, blog posts, emails, and so on.\r\n\r\nSo you’re investing seriously in getting people to that site.\r\n\r\nBut how’s it working?  Great? Okay?  Not so much?\r\n\r\nIf that answer could be better, then it’s likely you’re putting a lot of time, effort, and money into an approach that’s not paying off like it should.\r\n\r\nNow… imagine doubling your lead conversion in just minutes… In fact, I’ll go even better.\r\n \r\nYou could actually get up to 100X more conversions!\r\n\r\nI’m not making this up.  As Chris Smith, best-selling author of The Conversion Code says: Speed is essential - there is a 100x decrease in Leads when a Lead is contacted within 14 minutes vs being contacted within 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nHe’s backed up by a study at MIT that found the odds of contacting a lead will increase by 100 times if attempted in 5 minutes or less.\r\n\r\nAgain, out of the 100s of visitors to your website, how many actually call to become clients?\r\n\r\nWell, you can significantly increase the number of calls you get – with ZERO extra effort.\r\n\r\nTalkWithCustomer makes it easy, simple, and fast – in fact, you can start getting more calls today… and at absolutely no charge to you.\r\n\r\nCLICK HERE http://www.talkwithcustomer.com now to take a free, 14-day test drive to find out how.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nEric\r\n\r\nPS: Don’t just take my word for it, TalkWithCustomer works:\r\nEMA has been looking for ways to reach out to an audience.

He battled the Vanduul in Vega along with several classified battles not in open record. He worked his way up to the rank of <span style=\"color:#000000\">captain b</span>efore leaving the Army and settling in <span style=\"color:#000000\">Sol f</span>or a bit.</p>\r\n', '<p>BDON was born and raised in the Orion system on the planet Armitage. His parents were originally in the military but settled into farming to raise him and his sister. They settled mostly because they didn&#39;t want the military lifestyle for them but it didn&#39;t work out as planed. Being in a system with constant attacks from the Vanduul seemed to spark B-Don&#39;s interest in the military and he became heavily invested in joining the fight. On his 16th birthday, he woke up early and made his way to the city and to the local recruitment center and filled out the paperwork. He was informed of a shuttle leaving that evening to take new recruits to training, or he could wait until the following week. He was stoked to get his new life started so he started to head back home. And that&#39;s where everything changed. He got on his bike and the engine craped out on him so he had to walk 25 km back home. As he was walking and jogging he kept noticing strange things happening around him. People were packing their vehicles and leaving everywhere. There was a mass panic everywhere he went.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>About 10 km out someone ran into him and knocked him over. He stood up, picked the man up and was about to hit him when he noticed he was a neighbor of his by the name of scott. B-Don asked Scott what the hell was happening and he said the Planet is under attack! Before he had the chance to ask &quot;What!?&quot; A Vanduul Glaive made a fly by and one of the shots hit the ground near him, send him flying; knocking him out on a light post. As he came to, he had to push Scott off of him. He rolled off easy because his legs were missing and his back was burnt to the bone. He took most of the blast, sparing B-Don. He then realized Scott was running away from his house and he began to worry about his family. He picked up the pace and made his way back home through the wreckage and bodies. He even had to dodge a couple vanduul patrols. Once he made it out of the city, he had a clear shot home as most of the vanduul were pushing into the city and had already taken care of the outer city limits. He passed farm after farm and could see nothing but burnt fields and destroyed homes. Deep down, he knew what to expect. When he got there, he couldn&#39;t tell. It wasn&#39;t any different From the 30 other farms he passed. The field was nothing but ash as was the house. Completely vaporized. He never found any bodies. He realized the only way off this planet was that shuttle and it was leaving in an hour. Shit, it was back in the city center. He wouldn&#39;t make it on foot so he found the old beater car in the shed him and his dad were working on and tried to turn it on after a couple tries and a couple tweaks of the engine she turned over and roared to life. She didn&#39;t have a muffler so everywhere he went sounded like a machine gun going off. He pinned it and drove as fast as this old thing would take him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driving up to the city he noticed the vanduul were quickly closing in on the city center. As he was breaking through the back of the vanduul lines he took a hit from some stray shots. He broke through the line but the bullet broke through a major artery in his arm and he was bleeding bad. He made it to the UEE defense line and skid to to a hault. He booked it behind cover, holding his arm. He arrived just as they were falling back to their shuttles, so he hopped on the back of a dragonfly and got a ride to the shuttle. All the civilians were cramming themselfs into the shuttles as best they could but there wasn&#39;t enough shuttles for everyone. B-Don was put in his shuttle and was the last one in before they closed the doors and took off. Looking out the window, he watched as the rest of the shuttles took off; leaving behind hundreds of civilians and soldiers alike. And that&#39;s when the vanduul broke through one of the lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like a tital wave they flooded into the area and had no mercy. He watched as they began mowing down hundreds of men woman and children without any hesitation. A couple of the shuttles got shot down as well before he blacked out from blood loss. After he broke atmosphere and made his way to one of the UEEs last capital ships, there was only 2 or 3 shuttles left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHe woke up in the infirmary a couple days later in the Vega system. The fleet pulled out and he was one of the few who made it out. Once he recovered he wasted no time getting trained. He battled the Vanduul throughout his training in Vega along with battles in <span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:#000000\">@#LK$</span></span> and <span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:#000000\">QERJ@</span></span> serving under <span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:#000000\">@#L$KJ@#</span></span> <span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:#000000\">@#$Jl</span></span>, all of which are classified battles not in open record. He worked his way up to the rank of Captin. Many missions crossed paths with &quot;project <span style=\"color:#000000\"><span style=\"background-color:#000000\">@KD@#$!Ss </span></span>&quot;. before leaving the Army and settling in Sol for a bit. He did some side jobs to pass the time as retirement didn&#39;t suit him and became a contractor working for a supply and trading company.&nbsp; While traveling he met Zanigade in Stanton and agreed to come aboard as his Tactical Advisor. The rest, well that&#39;s history in the making my friends......</p>\r\n', 'Brandon', 'Vinall', '2017-05-16 16:16:38', '0000-00-00', 6, 0, 7, 1, '', 1, '2017-05-16 16:18:24', 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1),

Nova first came to Abdiah at the age of 17. His family was under attack by local pirates in the heart of the Oso system when Nova intervened. After witnessing ignorance be dispelled by raw power and skill, Abdiah begged the crew to join them. After months of applications, he finally stepped afoot his first Nova vessel. He never made his way up fast; they kept him in the dark. Each time they were off on missions, instead of mopping the corridors, Abdiah would practice in the shooting range or sprinting laps around the ship. After a shift in leadership, Abdiah quickly made his way up the ranks as his full potential was acknowledged. At first a mop boy. Then he became one of the intel-cargo boys. Soon after that, Abdiah became one of the organization&#39;s first translators as their reaches gripped further around the known &#39;verse. His ties with the Xi&#39;an and ability to gain their trust forced him to the rank of Lieutenant at such a young age.</p>\r\n', 'Dallan', 'Atwood', '2017-05-28 12:19:11', '0000-00-00', 14, 0, 2, 1, '', 3, '2017-05-28 12:24:14', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),

All you really need to know is that if you&#39;re ever working with me, they were a team. Meaning no one gets left behind. I&#39;ll push you to your limits, and in doing so, I expect you to punch&nbsp;me to mine.</p>\r\n', '<p>I was born on the outer-lying star known as Ayr&#39;ka on planet Ayr&#39;ka I. Officially marked as Non-habitable, this planet was used as a training ground for&nbsp;experiments. Being hidden made it easy for the Xi&#39;an to treat us terribly, conducting tons of experiments and feeding us the bare minimum. At birth, we were taken from our family&#39;s and thrown into chambers along with 3 others. In my group, there was me, a boy named Dan, a girl called Lily, and Rose. When we turned 5 they began our tests. We were sent into a large open room and told, &quot;you will be in here for 5 hours. If at the end of if you&#39;re still alive, you can see your families.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound disappeared and the room opened at the back wall, revealing a massive forest, with hills and the sound of flowing water. We were all confused but I quickly realized that this wasn&#39;t a normal, wait 5 hours. I told them that we needed to find a good place to set-up, somewhere easy to defend and with a good lookout over the land. As we were searching we heard a low snarl and saw something terrifying. A large black beast, with dark yellow eyes and claws as sharp as titanium. That was when I realized that, this wasn&#39;t our test. It was for these animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We ran up to the top of a waterfall where we found a good open flat place to set up. With the drop behind us and only a small entrance, it would be easy to defend. After 5 hours had passed we had set up a small shelter and a couple spears with which to defend ourselves. Dan then spoke up saying &quot;Why are we doing so much, 5 hours have passed and we&#39;ll be free soon&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;Actually, you&#39;re wrong, 6 hours have passed&quot; I responded.<br />\r\n&quot;So, whats the difference&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;The Difference is that they said 5, and they seem to be on a tight schedule.&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;Meaning what exactly?&quot;<br />\r\n&quot;Meaning we&#39;re never getting out of here. This isn&#39;t our test. It&#39;s to test out those Creatures that we saw. They&#39;ll leave us in here until we either die or make them stop the test to redesign.&quot;<br />\r\nLily and Rose looked at me in horror, Dan opened his mouth but couldn&#39;t get the words out to say anything. We were all terrified, knowing that we were here to die, to be feed to things that aren&#39;t even natural. We were Mice, trapped between the paws of a cat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We stayed there for 12 years, slowly building up and expanding our wall. When we were 17 Dan and Lily had a baby girl, who they named Sky. Times were peaceful and nice after we found out that the Darnen, that&#39;s what we called the beasts, were afraid of a type of mold growing on the rocks. We discovered that it was poison if it touched them, so we started building with it, layering it on our walls, spears, and houses. Eventually, we had a little town, everyone playing and working. Dan and Lily later had twins, Jack and Josh.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As time progressed we began to learn more about how to create things, eventually I and Dan made our first firearm, a very simple pistol, because of our growing up in such an advanced place, we knew a lot about how things worked. Dan was used as a mechanics servant when he was too young to be testing, so he knew the most out of all of us. Slowly over time, we began to climb, accelerating later to building things like lights, and generators, even creating a few turrets on the walls of our base.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another year passed, Rose and I were out exploring the land, past where we&#39;d ever gone before. There we found a massive ravine, with only a rock bridge connecting the two side for what seemed like miles. Behind us we heard the creatures closing in, so we quickly jumped down to a ledge and hid. What surprised us though was that they didn&#39;t come for us. They came for what was on the other side. From the forest emerged a couple of large white beasts. They looked like Direwolves. The two creatures seemed to converse before the black ones attacked over the ravine. After an hour the fight seemed to have ended. When we came up from the ledge we found trees destroyed, rocks broke, and bodies, bodies everywhere. Rose buried her head into my shoulder as we walked over the battlefield. We heard a whimpering coming from on of the rocks and ran over to see a tiny dire wolf pup, lying under one of the rocks. When I first picked him up he cried out and whimpered, trying to bite me, but soon curled up in my arms realizing that everyone it knew, was now dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We took the dire wolve home and brought him into the town. We healed him and raised him as our own, nurturing him back to health. As he grew older he played a lot with the kids, eventually saving Sky, who was playing outside of the wall, when an adolescent Darnen attacked her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 more years passed, we had now been here for 16 years, and were 21. We were all down at one of the valley&#39;s cliffside edges celebrating Rose&#39;s 21st birthday. Dan pulled out a big box and said it was explosive, he rigged it to the wall of the mountain and said. &quot;happy birthday rose.&quot; The bomb pulsated a beautiful white, purple, and black. An orb formed in the middle and expanded far out, then contracted inward, dissipating into nothingness. Left behind from the explosion was a hole in the rock, but past that, we saw something terrifying. A large corridor running behind the rock. We took everyone and walked into it, following it through until we reached a room entitled, &quot;control room&quot;. When we entered we discovered that all these years. All this time. We were being watched. On one of the computer&#39;s we saw a file titled, &quot;If you ever escape, read this&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the file, we found a message to, us. The message read. &quot;If you&#39;re reading this then that means you escaped the experiment, how I don&#39;t know, but congrats. You were placed in there 1 year ago, and today the experiment is being canceled, but they not letting you go. They&#39;ve killed off all the other subjects but I convinced them to leave you for the creatures. They agreed and left. I wanted to free you but knew you&#39;d just be shot if I did. So I had to leave. I hope you make it out soon. All I&#39;d ever wanted to say to you, since the beginning was that, no matter what you think I am, and how horrible you think I am, I just want you to know that, through everything, I&#39;m Sorry.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that was all. All these years, we had just been left here! Filled with anger we continued, following the lines on the wall to the hanger bay. We boarded a freelancer and took off. As the computer flew us away Dan put something in front of us all. A button. &quot;Before we left, I put that explosive in the &#39;Core room&#39;.&quot; We knew what that meant, and as we slowed the ship and pointed it toward the planet, we watched as all four of us pressed the button together. The planet lit up in a bright, yet beautiful purple light, and shattered, exploding in a peaceful harmony of rocks moving as though they had always wanted to. Through everything that had happened, I&#39;ll always remember one thing from that place, three words I could now say.<br />\r\nI Forgive You.</p>\r\n', 'Logan', 'Whittaker', '2017-06-28 19:57:07', '0000-00-00', 1, 0, 2, 1, '', 3, '2017-06-28 19:58:34', 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1),

Unfortunatly because of how isolated Trise is, they didn&#39;t want people leaving&nbsp;so he&nbsp;was able to sneek onto a trading ship&nbsp;and was able to get to the&nbsp;planet Stanton III, home of Arc Corp. From there he&nbsp;had&nbsp;been taking jobs every now and then&nbsp;from medical to bounty hunting.&nbsp;He was&nbsp;been too scared to leave the planet since he&nbsp;knew nothing else but the Banu&#39;s teachings. Luckily he&nbsp;came across a man named Keeves who recruited him&nbsp;into the Nova Black orgonization. Since then Captain Bdon has been teaching him&nbsp;about the universe, and what he&nbsp;can do to help the orgonization. Now he is&nbsp;a doctor&nbsp;helping in search and rescue mostly, but is&nbsp;willing and able to do whatever is required of him. His&nbsp;flying skills are not the best, but from his&nbsp;bounty hunting days he&nbsp;was taught by the infamous &quot;Red Raider&quot;&nbsp;to become proficient in subduing and capturing targets.
